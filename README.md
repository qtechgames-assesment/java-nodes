# java-nodes

Data tree structure is a way to organize and store data in hierarchical form. It
composed of nodes each connected by lines/edges. A parent node is a node
connected to another node downline. The downline node is a called a child node.
A child node can have its own children. A node with no children is called a leaf
node. The root node is the top most node and it doesnâ€™t have any parent. Each
child node can only be a child of one parent node.

Please create a restful API service (no UI) for node management system. It should
have the following functionalities:
1. add nodes
a. Given a node, user should be able to add a child to that node
2. delete nodes
a. Given a node, user should be able to delete a child of that node
3. move nodes from one parent to another
a. Given a node, a user should be able to transfer it to a different parent.
4. return the list of all downline nodes. For example, in the structure above,
a. Given a user invoked the endpoint to get he child nodes of A, response will
be [B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N]
b. Given a user invoked the endpoint to get he child nodes of D, response will
be [I, J, K, L, M, N]
c. Given a user invoked the endpoint to get he child nodes of C, response will
be [ ]
The application can start with a pre defined root node.
Requirements
Please use:
springboot, latest version
java 17 or later versions
any rdbms or no sql database
maven or gradle
Add a readme file which includes how to run/use/test your app. if your app is
able to host or include a generated 'how to use my web service' it would be

cool but not required

xheaders for the operations, correct use of HTTP Verbs, content negotiation
and entity representation.
Support json and xml as content-type
Submission
